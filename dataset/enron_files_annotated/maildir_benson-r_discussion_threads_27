B>A small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is telling 
B>clients to quickly dump Enron (ENE:NYSE - news), believing that the energy 
B>trading giant's 2001 earnings will fall well short of Wall Street's 
B>forecasts. 
B>Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Roberts, thinks 
B>Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus estimate of 
B>$1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $30, nearly 50% 
B>below Wednesday's $59.20. 
B>The firm's 26-page report, published May 6, highlights Enron's declining 
B>profitability and increasing leverage and suggests that the company should 
B>trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS
B>:NYSE - news), which has a 2001 price-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 
B>33 times. OWS also alleges that Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key 
B>parts of its financial statements are confusing and opaque. 
B>Houston-based Enron didn't comment by publication time on elements of the 
B>report that Detox sent the company. An energy analyst who is bullish on 
B>Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains fundamental misunderstandings 
B>about the energy market and Enron's business model, but he says the report 
B>does include some ground-breaking and valid insights. (The analyst's firm 
B>doesn't give stock recommendations.) 
B>Economies of Scale
B>Why care what Off Wall Street writes, compared with, say, analysts at Merrill 
B>Lynch (MER:NYSE - news)? For one, OWS has an excellent track record. 
B>Particularly sweet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed came crashing 
B>down. It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve, recommending 
B>that clients sell e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN:Nasdaq - news) in June 1999, 
B>when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and their prices at their 
B>most insane.

B>Pulling Back
B>Enron retreats after long rally
B>
B>
B>Enron, with its domination of a burgeoning energy market, annual revenue of 
B>over $100 billion and impressive earnings growth, can hardly be ranked 
B>alongside the likes of priceline. But OWS thinks Enron is set for a 
B>precipitous drop nonetheless. Why? 
B>OWS's main beef is that key profitability measures are in decline. Margins on 
B>Enron's pretax operating earnings (which the company's earnings releases call 
B>IBIT, or income before interest, taxes and other items) are falling. Total 
B>IBIT of $795 million in the first quarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 
B>billion in revenue for the period, compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth 
B>quarter and 4.75% in the year-earlier period. Revenue in the first quarter 
B>was nearly quadrupled from the year-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. 
B>This shrinkage is due to lower-margin trading income making up an 
B>increasingly large share of Enron's revenue base. 
B>OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 2001 Enron needs to generate an 
B>extra $2.1 billion in revenue for each additional penny it makes over its 
B>2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79. 
B>The energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasn't grasped how Enron can 
B>continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink. It does so simply by 
B>increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size. In other words, 
B>margins may decline, but since revenues are so much higher, earnings still go 
B>up. Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahead of 
B>the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percentage 
B>points. The analyst thinks Enron will make $1.82 per share in 2001. 
B>Growing On You
B>In addition, the huge growth in the energy market that has so helped Enron is 
B>likely to continue for several years, according to the analyst. He notes that 
B>roughly 75% of the electricity available in the U.S. still isn't traded in a 
B>market. "Eventually it will be part of a competitive environment, but it'll 
B>take five to 10 years," says the analyst. And he believes the extreme 
B>volatility in energy-related commodities that has also benefited Enron will 
B>exist for longer than OWS projects. 
B>Still, OWS's point on profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. 
B>Return on capital (net income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% 
B>in 2000, down on 1999's 6.9% and well below the 2000 returns on capital at 
B>Duke (DUK:NYSE - news) (11.8%), Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news) (12.1%) and even 
B>Goldman (8.9%). 
B>Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow. For 
B>example, it doesn't give a gross margin number for its wholesale services, or 
B>trading, business, which accounts for 96% of revenue. But one area of the 
B>company's financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange 
B>Commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron's 
B>related party transactions, which are the deals it does with entities that 
B>have some sort of link to the firm. In fact, one of the related entities that 
B>Enron has traded with is headed by Enron's CFO, Andrew Fastow. The energy 
B>analyst comments: "Why are they doing this? It's just inappropriate." 
B>The reason for maintaining these hard-to-follow related party deals has been 
B>a source of speculation. But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical fiber 
B>to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second quarter 
B>of 2000. Estimated profits from the so-called dark fiber (optical cable 
B>without the gear to send data over it) transaction allowed Enron to beat 
B>analysts' second-earnings earnings estimate by 2 cents a share, rather than 
B>missing by 2 cents. 
B>How soon before Wall Street follows Off Wall Street on Enron?
