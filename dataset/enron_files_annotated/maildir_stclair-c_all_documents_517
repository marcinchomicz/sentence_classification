B>Hello Parents!
B>
B>Camp is about to begin!  Are you ready?  Well, we are, and we're excited 
B>about it!!!  Here are some details that will hopefully answer any questions 
B>you might have about your child's experience in Enron's Kidventure summer 
B>camp.
B>
B>Camp officially begins each morning between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m.   You must 
B>bring your child to the Energizer private dining room by 8 a.m. (at the 
B>latest) each morning.  You do not need visitor badges for your children.  
B>Enron security is fully aware that you will be bringing your children in each 
B>morning.  We will have five dedicated Enron security guards helping us with 
B>the camp each day to ensure your child's safety while in the building.    
B>When going from the Energizer to the bus, your children will ride a dedicated 
B>elevator escorted by an Enron security guard.  Kidventure camp counselors 
B>will be active with your children as soon as you drop them off in the morning 
B>until the bus leaves at 8:15 a.m.   Your children will return to Enron at 4 
B>p.m. each afternoon, and will continue their Enron-site activities until you 
B>pick them up between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.  All children MUST be picked up by 5 
B>p.m.   A fee of $1 per minute after 5 p.m will be charged.
B>
B>At the beginning of each week of camp, you will pay the remainder of your 
B>balance to Kidventure Camps.  Your children will also receive their official 
B>camp t-shirt on the first day of camp.  You may purchase additional t-shirts 
B>for $10.00 each.  Each child will also make a name tag on their first day 
B>which they will use for their camp term.  
B>
B>Also, if you have not sent in your liability release forms, I must have them 
B>by tomorrow. Thanks!
B>
B>Hopefully I have answered all of your questions, if not, please call me at 
B>x37514 or e-mail me.
B>Thank you and have a great summer!
