B>
B>LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to 
B>order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis 
B>claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 
B>2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. 
B>
B>Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal 
B>Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from 
B>the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC 
B>lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent 
B>System Operator.  
B>   
B>That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could 
B>potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. 
B>
B>Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in 
B>unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC 
B>administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will 
B>likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis 
B>expects. 
B>
B>Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal, 
B>and that is to bring back $9 billion." 
B>
B>Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO 
B>documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
B>for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. 
B>
B>David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general 
B>manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but 
B>conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. 
B>
B>Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork 
B>for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from 
B>corporate energy suppliers. 
B>
B>But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press 
B>secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about 
B>getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated 
B>by FERC. 
B>
B>Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators 
B>overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. 
B>
B>State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation 
B>into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky 
B>calculations." 
B>
B>To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices 
B>received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been 
B>expected under competitive market conditions. 
B>
B>The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at 
B>times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices 
B>in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with 
B>air-quality rules. 
B>
B>The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern 
B>border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the 
B>fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. 
B>
B>The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power 
B>suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the 
B>conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. 
B>
B>The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest 
B>utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid 
B>operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the 
B>documents. 
B>
B>The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed 
B>amounts between May 2000 and February:
