B>Although I believe our assumptions are correct,  one of the outcomes of that 
B>meeting yesterday was that we agreed to go back and confirm our thoughts by 
B>applying them to 9/30 final results.  We will have that by Fri.  However, I 
B>just wanted to introduce some cautious optimism here until then.

B>Greg, could you forward your analysis to me.  I would like to see how the ENA 
B>changes are being applied.  Thanks!

B>All -

B>I think that the good news on North America funds flow has been communicated 
B>though out the halls.  May I suggest one last meeting with all of us to 
B>ensure that we are on the same page as to where we are, develop a preliminary 
B>strategy as to how to meet this year's target without overachieving and 
B>preserving the maximum amount of dry powder for next year.

B>I have a meeting on my calander for Friday, hopefully everyone on this 
B>distribution can attend.

B>
B>Earlier this morning I attended a meeting with Wes, Geogeanne Hodges and Joe 
B>Defner to review the various accounting issues around our PRM book.
B>
B>As a result of that meeting I distributed a revised funds flow/cash flow 
B>model, including a revised "shortfall page".
B>
B>I have some questions out on November YTD interest expense to confirm that we 
B>will still hit that target.  Once I can confirm that, we can look to see 
B>exactly how much we need in funds flow.
B>
B>I am out of the office this afternoon, but can be reached at 713-854-5507.

B>Thanks -- Greg
