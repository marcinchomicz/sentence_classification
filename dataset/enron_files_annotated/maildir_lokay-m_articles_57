B>El Paso, Coastal Consolidate Pipeline Staff
B>
B>El Paso Energy and Coastal Corp. announced plans yesterday to relocate more 
B>than 1,200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the El Paso Natural 
B>Gas headquarters in El Paso, TX, and the ANR Pipeline headquarters in 
B>Detroit, MI, once their merger is approved by the FTC, which is expected 
B>sometime in the fourth quarter. No final decision on staff reductions has 
B>been made, an El Paso spokeswoman said. 
B>
B>The companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline 
B>systems into three organizations, collectively led by John W. Somerhalder II. 
B>Under the consolidation plan, the combined company's nationwide pipeline 
B>system will be consolidated into three regional operations. The western 
B>region will consist of El Paso Natural Gas Company and Colorado Interstate 
B>Gas Company and will be headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO. The eastern 
B>region will consist of ANR Pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and will be 
B>headquartered in Houston. Southern Natural will make up the southeastern 
B>region headquartered in Birmingham, AL. 
B>
B>John Somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the El Paso 
B>Pipeline Group. Patricia A. Shelton, currently president of El Paso Natural 
B>Gas, will lead the consolidated western region pipelines. Jay Holm, currently 
B>responsible for El Paso's Australian pipeline assets, will return to the 
B>United States to become CEO of the eastern region. Reporting to Holm as 
B>presidents of Tennessee and ANR will be Stephen C. Beasley and James J. 
B>Cleary, respectively. The southeastern region will be led by James C. 
B>Yardley, who will continue as president of Southern. Shelton, Holm, and James 
B>Yardley will report to Somerhalder. 
B>
B>"This consolidation will create the most effective organization for El Paso's 
B>pipeline system," said El Paso CEO William A. Wise. "Our upcoming merger with 
B>Coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation, 
B>border to border and coast to coast. This consolidation represents a highly 
B>disciplined approach to managing this system, allowing us to strike a proper 
B>balance between customer focus and operational efficiency. It also 
B>facilitates a company-to-company exchange of expertise across our system and 
B>speeds the merging of separate company cultures." 
B>
B>While the companies will be organizationally merged, the five pipeline 
B>systems will remain separate with separate tariffs and separate names. Though 
B>many back office functions such as accounting and gas control will be 
B>consolidated and relocated to the new headquarters, field functions and 
B>related activities will remain in their current locations. In addition, some 
B>employees will remain in the El Paso and Detroit locations. The company will 
B>ask affected employees whether they want to be considered for relocation. 
B>Those employees who elect not to relocate will be given severance packages. 
B>Most moves will occur during the first half of next year, and the majority of 
B>the plan is expected to be implemented by mid-2001. 
B>
B>The companies announced their $16 billion polling-of-interests transaction in 
B>January (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19). The merger is expected to be accretive to 
B>El Paso's earnings per share (EPS) immediately and add more than 5% to EPS in 
B>both 2001 and 2002, Wise said at the time of the merger announcement. 
B>Overall, the two companies expect $200 million in cost savings. By 
B>comparison, the El Paso-Sonat merger created more than $100 million in 
B>savings and more than 600 people lost their jobs. 
B>
B>The combined interstate transmission system of the new company will consist 
B>of over 58,000 miles of pipeline, by far the most of any pipeline company in 
B>North America. The system will transport more than 20 Bcf/d of gas through 
B>existing pipeline infrastructure, but will have sole or part ownership in 
B>three other new or proposed major pipelines, including Alliance, Gulfstream 
B>and Independence. The company also will be the second largest gatherer of 
B>natural gas in the United States and the third largest U.S. producer of gas.
