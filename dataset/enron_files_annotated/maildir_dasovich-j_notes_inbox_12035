B>The attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the 
B>Commission this afternoon, in order to provide FERC staffers a concise, 
B>effective statement of our position while they drafted the Judge's 
B>recommendation.  I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner, at which 
B>Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the 
B>following high points: 
B>
B>1.  The methodology of the June 19 order does not work and is totally 
B>inappropriate for marketers.  If price mitigation is inevitable, the Judge 
B>should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology.
B>
B>2.  The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order 
B>must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and 
B>after October 2.
B>
B>3.  All buyers, including Enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just the 
B>State of California and its IOU's.  Enron is a net purchaser in these markets.
B>
B>4.  Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the 
B>methodology, not bilateral contracts, OOM sales or sales to the DWR. 
B>
B>The details of these points appear in the attached document.  The Judge was 
B>receptive to most points.  He understood the problems that the June 19 
B>methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this 
B>should be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form 
B>part of his recommendation.  He agreed that the actual buyers should receive 
B>refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be 
B>subject to the refund methodology.  Although he agreed that the refund 
B>methodology, once implemented, should yield just and reasonable rates, he 
B>felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the 
B>matter was up to the Commission.  The Judge spoke generally and no promises 
B>were made as to the content of his recommendations, but hopefully this 
B>insight will shed some light as to the outcome.  I urged the Judge to 
B>recommend placing conditions to refunds, as the Commission did in its June 19 
B>order with its RTO filing requirement.  The judge was noncommittal on this, 
B>although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset.
B>
B>Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday.  The Judge told 
B>us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday, and that 
B>the comments would accompany the recommendation.  Thereafter, it is likely 
B>that the Commission would defer to the Judge's recommendation to hold a fast 
B>track evidentiary hearing of 60 days duration, to determine "unresolved 
B>issues of material fact".  The scope of the hearing has not been determined, 
B>but  will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for 
B>marketers to recommend an alternative methodology.
