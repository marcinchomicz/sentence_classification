B>Sara, 
B>
B>Moreover, with the exception of the email dated on the 20th, the other emails 
B>are not addressed to me; indeed, a major concern of mine which clearly slowed 
B>down the execution of this package of agreements  was that I was not included 
B>in conversations about the status and any change in deadlines etc.  Perhaps 
B>in part that is because for the bulk of the time period in which we worked on 
B>Enron Credit Inc., you took responsibility for the Bear Stearns agreements 
B>until you turned the agreements over to me at 3 p.m. on Friday the 12th and I 
B>began, at that time a legal review of the agreements.  Moreover, no one 
B>represented to me at that time that this agreement had to be done first and 
B>right away.  I just learned that last week from the business people when I 
B>reported that the Morgan agreements were ready for execution.  I had 
B>completed my review of the other two Enron Credit Inc. account agreements.  
B>Furthermore, you indicated that I should keep the paralegals involved; my 
B>records of this project indicate that you asked Stephanie to complete the 
B>Authorized Officers list, and that you had signed off on it.
