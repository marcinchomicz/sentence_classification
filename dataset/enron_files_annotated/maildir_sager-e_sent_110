B>undeliverables...I would appreciate your letting me know if you receive this 
B>message...thanks.
B>Working Group Members:
B>
B>The drafting commitee met on September 15 to discuss the status of the Master 
B>Agreement and the agenda for the October 13 meeting at EEI's offices.  The 
B>general consensus of the drafting committee is that the Master Agreement is 
B>sound and there is no need for revision to the base terms and conditions of 
B>version 2.1.  Based on that meeting, the drafting committee would like to 
B>cover the following at the October 13 meeting :
B>
B>GETTING CONTRACT IN PLACE.  The drafting committee believes that the number 
B>one priority is to get the Master Agreement used by more participants in the 
B>marketplace.   We would like to hear from the working group about the status 
B>of the Master Agreement in their organizations and issues about the contract 
B>that are holding up its use.  We will solicit suggestions on how to get wider 
B>acceptance of the Master Agreement.  The drafting committee has thought of 
B>holding another workshop in late January to address implementation issues 
B>such as establsihing credit thresholds.
B>
B>STANDARDIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS.  There are  several areas not addressed 
B>in the base contract that are frequently used as customized supplemental 
B>provisions identified on many parties' cover sheets.  The drafting committee 
B>identified the following as useful to develop as suggested optional 
B>supplemental provisions that could be used in negotiating a cover sheet with 
B>a counterparty:   (1)  the incorporation of prior transactions as being 
B>governed by the Master Agreement; (2) the use of the Master Agreement for 
B>electronic trading; (3) alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; (4) 
B>treatment of new taxes or changes in regulatory policy; (5) additional 
B>products (e.g. Western firm or CAISO energy); (6) agreements with respect to 
B>agency relationships; (7) "regulatory out" provisions; and (8) provisions 
B>involving "one-way" counterparty relationships, i.e. sales only or purchases 
B>only.
B>
B>The drafting committee will ask the working group to allow it to develop 
B>these provisions and once consensus on language is reached among the drafting 
B>committee members, they would be made available for downloading on the EEI 
B>website for use by the industry as suggested optional provisions.  We will 
B>also discuss the ways to tie these provisions to the Master Agreement general 
B>terms.
B>
B>
B>PROCEDURE FOR GETTING CONTRACT INTERPRETATION.  The drafting committee will 
B>discuss ways to get answers about the contract disseminated quickly.  One 
B>suggestion is to have a frequently asked questions section up on the EEI 
B>website.
B>
B>As a reminder, the meeting will be held from 10-4.  Please contact me if you 
B>have any questions or comments about the agenda.   If you plan to attend or 
B>need information about hotels or transportation, please contact Patricia 
B>Young at 202-508-5757 or pyoung@eei.org. Thank-you.
