B>I spoke with Ken about the Business Council.  He agreed: errors of commission 
B>are much better than errors of omission.  H e does want to be personally 
B>involved in the invitations from here on and he is very willing to make calls 
B>next week to help get some confirmations.  Deal directly with him . . . 
B>there's no need for me to be in the middle.  Also, a bit of background:

B>want to offer him a speaking spot because he won't speak without the press 
B>present.

B>at my fingertips.
