B>Rick,
B>
B>Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support 
B>function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we 
B>already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.
B>
B>The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more 
B>permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry 
B>understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we 
B>would give him/her the job. 
B>
B>I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the 
B>team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant 
B>value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'. 
B>However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and, 
B>whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I 
B>can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.
B>
B>I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted 
B>within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in 
B>London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy 
B>to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will 
B>be monitoring the situation very closely.
B>
B>Regards
B>
B>Fernley.
