B>Steven,
B>
B>Thank you for visiting with my class at Rice last night. They thoroughly
B>enjoyed your talk -- after you left for the evening, we had a good
B>discussion on topics that you had raised. My apologies again for the room
B>mix up; somehow between myself, the university, and my secretary, the
B>classroom assignment changed several times and the update did not get to
B>you.
B>
B>Next year, if your schedule permits, perhaps you would consider a return
B>engagement. I would certainly enjoy having you back.
B>
B>Regards,
B>John
