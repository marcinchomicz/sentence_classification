B>> National Grid is changing Internet Service Providers, and a change may be
B>> needed to your setup for downloading Massachusetts Electric Default
B>> Customer Lists.  If the changes described below are not made, you will
B>> find that you cannot log in to the National Grid FTP server,
B>> ftp.us.ngrid.com, after this weekend.
B>>
B>> The change is straightforward -- you initially received instructions to
B>> enter the hostname IP address 204.164.80.201 when you installed the FTP
B>> client (WS_FTP Pro) on your computer.  The change that needs to be made is
B>> to replace the IP address number with the text ftp.us.ngrid.com.
B>>
B>> To update your installation, please do the following:
B>> *	Start WS_FTP Pro on your computer
B>> *	When you see the initial directory screen with the WS_FTP sites
B>> listed, highlight the ftp.us.ngrid.com item with a single click (do not
B>> double click -- this will take you to the password entry instead of the
B>> Properties screen noted below)
B>> *	With the ftp.us.ngrid.com entry highlighted, click the "Properties"
B>> button on the right hand border of the dialog box
B>> *	On the "General" tab of the Properties screen, replace the entry in
B>> the "Host Name/Address" box with the text ftp.us.ngrid.com, (the same as
B>> the entry in the "Site Name" box)
B>> *	Click the "OK" button
B>>
B>> You should now be able to log in to the site with the current password,
B>> and future IP address changes by National Grid should not require any
B>> change to the WS_FTP Pro client setup.
