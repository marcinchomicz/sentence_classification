B>Congratulations!  Sounds like the merchant storage business has had a good 
B>couple of weeks with you guys clearing your environmental hurdles and the 
B>Tioga guys finally starting construction!  I may have acted rashly in joining 
B>the evil empire--should have jumped into the storage business instead!  
B>
B>Tom, are you the point guy for marketing the project?  I'd like to hook you 
B>up with our Transwestern marketing guys on possible deals to backstop 
B>Transwestern's "Park and Ride" service.  We are currently authorized by FERC 
B>to use PG&E market center service for that purpose, but I suspect firm or 
B>interruptible Lodi service  would be better suited for what we need.     
B>
B>Best wishes for continued success!

B>CA Merchant Storage Plant Passes Major Test
B>
B>     California regulators Thursday released a final environmental impact 
B>report for the
B>     state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the 
B>Sacramento
B>     Valley of northern California. Absent new opposition from surrounding 
B>landowners,
B>     Texas-based Western Hub Properties hopes to have its $80 million storage 
B>project
B>     operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the 
B>approval process for
B>     environmental review. 
B>
B>     Western Hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project 
B>in Texas and
B>     it has identified a site for a second California storage operation in 
B>the Bakersfield area,
B>     according to Jim Fossum, Western's California operations manager. 
B>
B>     Final approval of the Lodi Gas Storage Project located south of 
B>Sacramento should
B>     come in May, Fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this 
B>summer and be
B>     operational before the end of the year. "We see the environmental report 
B>as the 'light at
B>     the end of the tunnel'," Fossum said. 
B>
B>     Under California's environmental review process (CEQA), the California 
B>Public Utilities
B>     Commission (CPUC) prepared a draft environmental report (EIR) 
B>identifying the
B>     project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The draft then 
B>was circulated
B>     to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before 
B>the final
B>     report can be issued. Three public hearings on the draft report were 
B>held by the CPUC
B>     last October. 
B>
B>     Under the CPUC's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative 
B>law judge
B>     for the case is due by mid-March, after which there is a 30-day period 
B>before the
B>     project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, 
B>a CPUC
B>     spokesperson said. 
B>
B>     "We hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already 
B>have our
B>     compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and 
B>that can go pretty
B>     quickly," Fossum said. "In the best of all worlds it would be this year; 
B>in the worst case,
B>     it would be a year from now." 
B>
B>     Western Hub has some of its customers lined up, and it is in current 
B>discussions with
B>     others, said Fossum, declining for competitive reasons to even identify 
B>the types of
B>     customers, although they are expected to be large shippers, marketers, 
B>power plant
B>     operators and other large industrial customers. 
B>
B>     The Lodi project is designed for full operation as having a 12 Bcf 
B>working capacity,
B>     with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacities. It will 
B>be
B>     connected to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone transmission system 
B>through a
B>     35-mile pipeline consisting of three miles of 30-inch-diameter and 32 
B>miles of
B>     24-inch-diameter pipe. During the past year's delay in start-up, Western 
B>has "moved
B>     the pipeline around a bit, but not a whole lot," Fossum said. "to make 
B>accommodations
B>     to nearby farmers." 
B>
B>     Western Hub's similar-sized Texas project is south of San Antonio and 
B>would be
B>     connected with three natural gas transmission systems in the area: 
B>Houston Pipeline,
B>     PG&E --- Texas (bought recently by El Paso) and the City of San Antonio. 
B>"We
B>     expect to have it on-line the same time as Lodi," Fossum said. 
B>
B>     Fossum said Western is "moving ahead" with a second California site in 
B>the Bakersfield
B>     area, but he declined to give any further details, noting Western Hub 
B>expects to have
B>     more definitive information next month. He did say that if a second 
B>California project
B>     moves ahead, Western expects to have it operational by early 2002. 
B>
B>     Unlike northern California, storage in the Bakersfield area would not 
B>have to connect
B>     with the local utility transmission system of Southern California Gas. 
B>The combined
B>     Kern River/ Mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area.
