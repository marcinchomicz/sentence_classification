B>An interesting piece of information from the oil markets. 
B>Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down
B>production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).
B>
B>The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst).
B>He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations.
B>He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in
B>his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the
B>oil futures markets. I personally discount this info: the volume and 
B>transparency of
B>the oil markets  would not support this type of huge scale operations by 
B>Saddam's
B>government. There may be some trading by Iraqi officials on the side.
