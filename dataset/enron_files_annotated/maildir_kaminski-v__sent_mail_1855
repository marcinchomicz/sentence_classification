B>Dear Vince:
B>
B>How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember
B>me, we met in a conference last year in Houston. After
B>having been working for Williams for about two years,
B>now I am ready to make a move. I have heard Enron is a
B>great company, I am wondering whether there is any
B>opportunity for me, either in research group or in
B>structure group
B>
B>Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
B>got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
B>University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
B>company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
B>and in charge of the quantitative research group with
B>7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
B>research and modeling about electricity,
B>load-following deal and tolling deals.
B>
B>If you need any additional information, please feel
B>free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to
B>hearing from you soon, thank you.
B>
B>sincerely,
B>Charles
