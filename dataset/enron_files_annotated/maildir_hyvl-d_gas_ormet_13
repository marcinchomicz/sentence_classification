B>Dan,

B>Mike,
B>     I have reviewed the attached marked copy of the transaction agreement
B>and have gone over the changes with Craig.  Please change the term "best
B>efforts" which was added in the 14th line of Item 1 under Other to read
B>"commercially reasonable best efforts".  This will keep the concept the
B>same throughout the document where we use the term "commercially reasonable
B>best efforts".  With this change, please print out two copies of the
B>contract and two copies of the transaction agreement and proceed with
B>execution of each.  Please call if you have any questions.
