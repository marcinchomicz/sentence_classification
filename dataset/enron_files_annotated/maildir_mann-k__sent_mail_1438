B>Leatha,

B>I have a couple of questions.  Do your numbers assume $7500 down (in addition 
B>to the tax etc), and is the term 36 months or 48?  Both time frames are 
B>mentioned in your explanation.  
B>
B>Have we heard anything on the remarketing of my Lexus?  Does the cost include 
B>the tax trade on the Lexus?

B>Thanks for your help,

B>Hi Leatha,
B>
B>Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it,
B>however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the
B>extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we
B>asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.
B>They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.
B>When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the
B>wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount
B>the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get
B>reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to
B>"work on it".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.
B>
B>I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my
B>Lexus.
B>
B>Thanks,
B>
B>Kay
