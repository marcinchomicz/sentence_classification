B>Paul,
B>While I think it is reasonable for you to request an increase to your limits, 
B>as you may know, the Board doesn't meet until May 2.  It would be somewhat 
B>unprecedented to leave a "proprietary" position over the limit for that 
B>length of time, i.e., the Australian Electricity book would far exceed the 
B>number of position limit violations for any other commodities.  I have left a 
B>message for Greg and will speak to Rick Buy today.  In the meantime, I 
B>suggest that you put together a request for approval to increase your limits 
B>to be presented at the first opportunity.
B>Ted
